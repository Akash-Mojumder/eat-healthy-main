                        When it comes to Americanized Chinese food, there’s a few flavor profiles that get all the love, like kung pao, bang bang, and beef with broccoli. We’ve included a ton of recipes for them here, like kung pao shrimp noodles and brussels sprouts, bang bang cauliflower and shrimp, and beef and broccoli noodles and kebabs. We’ve also got some Mongolian-inspired recipes that have made their way to Chinese food menus over the years—we know you’ll love the mild sweet and salty sauce on everything from meatballs to chicken wings.
                        
                        This list is all about the classics you’ll recognize from places like Panda Express, like fried rice and general tso’s chicken, but we’ve also included a few recipes you’re more likely to find in a Chinese home than a mall, like sichuan-style eggplant and congee. Join us in expanding our horizons and trying new flavor profiles and textures, like szechuan peppercorns. Their unique lip-tingling flavor is unlike anything else, and makes a number of these dishes stand</p>

                        <li>Heat 1 tsp of oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>  
        
                        <li>Add ginger paste, garlic paste, chilli paste, vinegar and sliced chicken pieces. Add salt to taste and saute for couple minutes (add water if needed to saute).</li>  
        
                        <li>Add ketchup, sugar, soy sauce, chopped shrimps and continue to cook for 5 minutes. </li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and set aside.</li>   
        
                        <li>In a deep skillet or saucepot, add 6 cups of room-temperature water. Do not turn on heat as we need to mix everything together before cooking it.  
                        </li>
                        <li>In a separate bowl, add 3 tbsp of water and stir in corn starch. Add an egg and mix everything well, be sure to have no lumps. Add the egg mixture to the water and mix well. </li> 
        
                        <li>Continue to stir and mix everything, this step is important to adjust the temperature of egg mixture. If not mixed well, the egg will break apart and the soup may be clotted and not smooth.   </li>
        
                        <li>Turn on heat to low-medium temperature and add in lemongrass pieces and galangal ginger slices. Cook for 5 mins at low heat, stirring continuously.   </li>
        
                        <li>Add 1 cup chicken stock and chicken-shrimp mixture into the soup. Cook for 10 minutes at medium heat, stirring continuously.   
                        </li>
                        <li>Add green chilli, black pepper and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Cook until the soup has reached the desired consistency.  
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately.</li>
                    </ol>
        
                        Serve hot alongside hot crispy wontons. Enjoy!
